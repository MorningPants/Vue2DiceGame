# Dice Game
This is a simple web application built with Vue.js and Vuetify. It allows users to play a dice game where they can roll multiple dice and see the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MorningPants/Vue2DiceGame.git

- Run the application: npm run serve

This will start a development server at http://localhost:8080 where you can view the application in your browser.

## Usage
The application consists of three pages: Home, Game, and Login/Signup.

## Home
The Home page is a simple landing page with a welcome message and a button to navigate to the Game page.

## Game
The Game page allows users to roll two dice and see the results. It also displays a list of the previous rolls. If the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the Login/Signup page.

## Login/Signup
The Login/Signup page allows users to log in to an existing account or create a new one. Once logged in, the user will be redirected back to the Game page.
